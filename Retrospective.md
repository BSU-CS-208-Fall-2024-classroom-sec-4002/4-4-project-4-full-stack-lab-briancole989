## Experience

This project ( although very fun, ) was a comaplete nightmare at times. I struggled to get the 'tasks.length' variable in 'index' to stop crashing on me for at least an hour. I probably couldve started on a workaround earlier, but I had a couple OTHER problems going on and wasn't sure what the best problem to focus on was. Eventually I found the 'redirect' method that served as a 'saving grace' to my overheating mental engine. I'm certain this project wasn't as nearly as I made it out to be, but for a good portion of the project I spent my time rereading through the zybook reading to find something I felt I must have been missing. DESPITE these issues, I feel this was defenitely a good experiene overall as learning not only how to develop both front and backend projects is invalueble to me as a a student looking to enter the jobfield, but the integration of back TO frontend is a side of things I always wondered.
